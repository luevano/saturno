## Providers

At this point, only MangaSee is unique to these providers, and only because it requires to make clicks with the headless browser. But these can be used as examples to create other providers that are not yet implemented in [mangoprovider](https://github.com/luevano/luaprovider).

- [mangadex](mangadex/main.lua) - As an example, minimal functionality, better implemented in `mangoprovider`s.
- [mangapill](mangapill/main.lua) - As an example, implemented in `mangoprovider`s.
- [mangasee](mangasee/main.lua)
